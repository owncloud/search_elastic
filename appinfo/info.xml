	<description>This app uses a separate elasticsearch cluster to enable
		searching in content and meta data of files.

		Depending on the file size, version and content of PDF / office
		files indexing may fail. This is a known issue and help is welcome
		to get these problems reproduced and sorted out. Start by having a
		look at the skipped unit tests.
